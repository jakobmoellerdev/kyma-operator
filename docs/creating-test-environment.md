# Creating the Clusters

## Setup Control Plane and Runtime Equivalent

### Local Setup

```sh
k3d cluster create op-skr --registry-create op-skr-registry.localhost
k3d cluster create op-kcp --registry-create op-kcp-registry.localhost
```

### Use External Clusters

Make sure to have two `KUBECONFIG` compliant client configurations at hand, one for kcp, one for skr

## Setting up your registry

### Make sure the registries are reachable via localhost

Add the following to your `etc/hosts` entry.

```/etc/hosts
##
# Host Database
#
# localhost is used to configure the loopback interface
# when the system is booting.  Do not change this entry.
##
127.0.0.1       localhost
255.255.255.255 broadcasthost
::1             localhost

# Added by Docker Desktop
# To allow the same kube context to work on the host and the container:
127.0.0.1 kubernetes.docker.internal

# Added for Operator Registries
127.0.0.1 op-kcp-registry.localhost
127.0.0.1 op-skr-registry.localhost
```

### Using an external Registry

TODO

## Make sure you are in the Control Plane

```
kubectl config use k3d-op-kcp
```

## Install CRDs of Operator Stack

_Note for Remote Clusters: Make sure you run the commands with `KUBECONFIG` set to the KCP Cluster_

### Install Manifest Operator CRDs

1. Checkout https://github.com/kyma-project/manifest-operator
2. Run the Installation Command

```
make install
```

### Install Kyma Operator CRDs

1. Checkout https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma-operator and `cd operator`
2. Run the Installation Command

```
make install
```

Ensure the CRDs are installed with `k get crds | grep kyma-project.io`:

```
manifests.component.kyma-project.io        2022-08-18T16:27:21Z
kymas.operator.kyma-project.io             2022-08-18T16:29:28Z
moduletemplates.operator.kyma-project.io   2022-08-18T16:29:28Z
```

## Build your module

In `https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma-operator`, `cd samples/template-operator`

After this find the Port of your KCP OCI Registry and write it to `MODULE_REGISTRY_PORT`:

### Using a Local Module/Image Registry

```
export MODULE_REGISTRY_PORT=$(docker port op-kcp-registry.localhost 5000/tcp | cut -d ":" -f2)
export IMG_REGISTRY_PORT=$(docker port op-skr-registry.localhost 5000/tcp | cut -d ":" -f2)
```

### Using a Remote Module/Image Registry

```
export MODULE_REGISTRY=your-registry-goes-here.com
export IMG_REGISTRY=your-registry-goes-here.com
```

### Generating and Pushing the Operator Image and Charts

Next generate and push the module image of the operator

```
make module-operator-chart module-image
```

## Use your module and trigger a Kyma Installation

_Note for Remote Clusters: Make sure you run the commands with `KUBECONFIG` set to the KCP Cluster_

First make sure that the `kyma-system` namespace is created:

```
kubectl create ns kyma-system
```

After this, build and push the module the module to the Registry with

```
make module-build module-template-push
```

Before we start reconciling, lets create a secret to access the SKR:

In https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma-operator run

`sh config/samples/secret/k3d-secret-gen.sh`

_Note for externally created clusters: You can use KCP_CLUSTER_CTX and SKR_CLUSTER_CTX to adjust your contexts for applying the secret._

## Run the operators

_Note for Remote Clusters: Make sure you run the commands with `KUBECONFIG` set to the KCP Cluster_

In https://github.com/kyma-project/kyma-operator run

```
make run
```

In https://github.com/kyma-project/manifest-operator run

```
make run
```

## Start the Installation

_Note for Remote Clusters: Make sure you run the commands with `KUBECONFIG` set to the KCP Cluster_

Create a request for kyma installation of the module with

```
sh hack/gen-kyma.sh
kubectl apply -f kyma.yaml
```

Now try to check your kyma installation progress, e.g. with `kubectl get kyma -n kyma-system -ojsonpath={".items[0].status"} | yq -P`:

```yaml
conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2022-08-18T18:10:09Z"
    message: module is Ready
    reason: template
    status: "True"
    type: Ready
moduleInfos:
  - moduleName: template
    name: templatekyma-sample
    namespace: kyma-system
    templateInfo:
      channel: stable
      generation: 1
      gvk:
        group: component.kyma-project.io
        kind: Manifest
        version: v1alpha1
observedGeneration: 1
state: Ready
```

Also, you can observe the installation in the runtime by switching the context to the SKR context and then verifying the status.

`k config use-context k3d-op-skr && kubectl get samples.component.kyma-project.io -n kyma-system -ojsonpath={".items[0].status"} | yq -P`

and it should show `state: Ready`.

You can verify this by checking if the contents of the `module-chart`directry in `template-operator/operator/module-chart`have been installed and parsed correctly.

You can even check the contents of the deployments that were generated by the deployed operator (assuming the helm chart did not change the name of the resource):
`k get -f operator/module-chart/templates/deployment.yaml -ojsonpath={".status.conditions"} | yq`
